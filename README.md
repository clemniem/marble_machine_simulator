# Marble Machine Simulator

Web-based simulation where you build marble runs with a visual node editor.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Run locally

Start the Vite dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173). You should see "Marble Machine Simulator" in the browser.

## Run tests

One-off run:

```

All tests live under `src/**/__tests__/*.test.ts` and use Vitest.
